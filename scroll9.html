        <h1>The Scroll Marked IX</h1>
        <p>My dreams are worthless, my plans are dust, my goals are impossible.</p>
        <p>All are of no value unless they are followed by action/</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>Never has there been a map, however carefully executed to detail and scale, which carried its owner over even one inch of ground. Never has there been a parchment of law, however fair, which prevented one crime. Never has there been a scroll, even such as the one I hold, which earned so much as a penny or produced a single word of acclamation. Action, alone, is the tinder which ignites the map, the parchment, this scroll, my dreams, my plans, my goals, into a living force. Action is the food and drink which will nourish my success.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>My procrastination which has held me back was born of fear and now I recognize this secret mined from the depths of all courageous hearts. Now I know that to conquer fear I must always act without hesitation and the flutters in my heart will vanish. Now I know that action reduces the lion of terror to an ant of equanimity.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>Henceforth, I will remember the lesson of the firefly who gives of its light only when it is on the wing, only when it is in action. I will become a firefly and even in the day my glow will be seen in spite of the sun. Let others be as butterflies who preen their wings yet depend on the charity of a flower for life. I will be as the firefly and my light will brighten the world.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>I will not avoid the tasks of today and charge them to tomorrow for I know that tomorrow never comes. Let me act now even though my actions may not bring happiness or success for it is better to act and fail than not to act and flounder. Happiness, in truth, may not be the fruit plucked by my action yet without action all fruit will die on the vine.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>I will act now. I will act now. I will act now. Henceforth, I will repeat these words again and again and again, each hour, each day, every day, until the words become as much a habit as my breathing and the actions which follow become as instinctive as the blinking of my eyelids. With these words I can condition my mind to perform every act necessary for my success. With these words I can condition my mind to meet every challenge which the failure avoids.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>I will repeat these words again and again and again.</p>
        <p>When I wake I will say them and leap from my cot while the failure sleeps yet another hour.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>When I enter the market place I will say them and immediately confront my first prospect while the failure ponders yet his possibility of rebuff.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>When I face a closed door I will say them and knock while the failure waits outside with fear and trepidation.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>When I face temptation I will say them and immediately act to remove myself from evil.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>When I am tempted to quit and begin again tomorrow I will say them and immediately act to consummate another sale.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>Only action determines my value in the market place and to multiply my value I will multiply my actions. I will walk where the failure fears to walk. I will work when the failure seeks rest. I will talk when the failure remains silent. I will call on ten who can buy my goods while the failure makes grand plans to call on one. I will say it is done before the failure says it is too late.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>For now is all I have. Tomorrow is the day reserved for the labor of the lazy. I am not lazy. Tomorrow is the day when the evil become good. I am not evil. Tomorrow is the day when the weak become strong. I am not weak. Tomorrow is the day when the failure will succeed. I am not a failure.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>When the lion is hungry he eats. When the eagle has thirst he drinks. Lest they act, both will perish.</p>
        <p>I hunger for success. I thirst for happiness and peace of mind. Lest I act I will perish in a life of failure, misery, and sleepless nights.</p>
        <p>I will command, and I will obey mine own command.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
        <p>Success will not wait. If I delay she will become betrothed to another and lost to me forever. This is the time. This is the place. I am the man.</p>
        <p>I will act now.</p>
