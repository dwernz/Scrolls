        <h1>The Scroll Marked VI</h1>
        <p>Today I will be master of my emotions.</p>
        <p>The tides advance; the tides recede. Winter goes and summer comes. Summer wanes and the cold increases. The sun rises; the sun sets. The moon is full; the moon is black. The birds arrive; the birds depart. Flowers bloom; flowers fade. Seeds are sown; harvests are reaped. All nature is a circle of moods and I am a part of nature and so, like the tides, my moods will rise; my moods will fall.</p>
        <p>Today I will be master of my emotions.</p>
        <p>It is one of nature's tricks, little understood, that each day I awaken with moods that have changed from yesterday. Yesterday's joy will become today's sadness; yet today's sadness will grow into tomorrow's joy. Inside me is a wheel, constantly turning from sadness to joy, from exultation to depression, from happiness to melancholy. Like the flowers, today's full bloom of joy will fade and wither into despondency, yet I will remember that as today's dead flower carries the seed of tomorrow's bloom so, too, does today's sadness carry the seed of tomorrow's joy.</p>
        <p>Today I will be master of my emotions.</p>
        <p>And how will I master these emotions so that each day will be productive? For unless my mood is right the day will be a failure. Trees and plants depend on the weather to flourish but I make my own weather, yea I transport it with me. If I bring rain and gloom and darkness and pessimism to my customers then they will react with rain and gloom and darkness and pessimism and they will purchase naught. If I bring joy and enthusiasm and brightness and laughter to my customers they will react with joy and enthusiasm and brightness and laughter and my weather will produce a harvest of sales and a granary of gold for me.</p>
        <p>Today I will be master of my emotions.</p>
        <p>And how will I master my emotions so that every day is a happy day, and a productive one? I will learn this secret of the ages: <em>Weak is he who permits his thoughts to control his actions; strong is he who forces his actions to control his thoughts.</em> Each day, when I awaken, I will follow this plan of battle before I am captured by the forces of sadness, self-pity and failure&mdash;</p>
        <ul class="text-list">
            <li>
                <small>If I feel depressed I will sing.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel sad I will laugh.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel ill I will double my labor.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel fear I will plunge ahead.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel inferior I will wear new garments.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel uncertain I will raise my voice.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel poverty I will think of wealth to come.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel incompetent I will remember past success.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel insignificant I will remember my goals.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>Today I will be master of my emotions.</small>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Henceforth, I will know that only those with inferior ability can always be at their best, and I am not inferior. There will be days when I must constantly struggle against forces which would tear me down. Those such as despair and sadness are simple to recognize but there are others which approach with a smile and the hand of friendship and they can also destroy me. Against them, too, I must never relinquish control&mdash;</p>
        <ul class="text-list">
            <li>
                <small>If I become overconfident I will recall my failures.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I overindulge I will think of past hungers.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel complacency I will remember my competition.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I enjoy moments of greatness I will remember moments of shame.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel all-powerful I will try to stop the wind.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I attain great wealth I will remember one unfed mouth.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I become overly proud I will remember a moment of weakness.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>If I feel my skill is unmatched I will look at the stars.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>Today I will be master of my emotions.</small>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>And with this new knowledge I will also understand and recognize the moods of him on whom I call. I will make allowances for his anger and irritation of today for he knows not the secret of controlling his mind. I can withstand his arrows and insults for now I know that tomorrow he will change and be a joy to approach.</p>
        <p>No longer will I judge a man on one meeting; no longer will I fail to call again tomorrow on he who meets me with hate today. This day he will not buy gold chariots for a penny, yet tomorrow he would exchange his home for a tree. My knowledge of this secret will be my key to great wealth.</p>
        <p>Today I will be master of my emotions.</p>
        <p>Henceforth I will recognize and identify the mystery of moods in all mankind, and in me. From this moment I am prepared to control whatever personality awakes in me each day. I will master my moods through positive action and when I master my moods I will control my destiny.</p>
        <p>Today I control my destiny, and my destiny is to become the greatest salesman in the world!</p>
        <p>I will become master of myself.</p>
        <p>I will become great.</p>
